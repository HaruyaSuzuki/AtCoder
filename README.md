# AtCoder
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-4682b4?style=for-the-badge&logo=cplusplus)

Use AtCoder for learning in C++.
As for the notation, I would like to aim to submit it in a state where it is possible through norminette as well as 42.

## Compiler
GCC

## input, output
- input uses cin
```
cin >> n;
```
- output uses cout
```
cout << n;
```

## g++ options
-0, -O0, -O1, -O2, -O3, -Os, -Ofast, -Og


## Optimization of C++
- Supports automatic vectorization of the compiler, vectorizes loop processing, and optimization.
```
#pragma GCC target("avx")
```
- Use -O3 because -Ofast ignores strict standards compliance.
```
#pragma GCC optimize("O3")
```
- Divide and reduce the maximum number of loopsï¼ˆIncrease the number of loops themselves and decrease the number of loops. Not recommended when the number of loops in the code is not high).
```
#pragma GCC optimize("unroll-loops")
```
